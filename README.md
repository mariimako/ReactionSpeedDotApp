# Idea 2: Survival Dot

## A simple but fun to play endless survival game!

This project is a **2D survival game**. The player will be controlling a single character to move around and dodge
projectiles, eliminate enemies, gain and upgrade weapons and try to reach a high score. As the game progresses, enemies
will increases and different enemies will appear.

This project is interest to me because I personally loved games that are endless and require beating a high score. 
I have programmed several games before, but I want to create one that is simple but fun and easy to play on desktop.

The following will be some characteristics of the game:

- Player will have hitpoints that decrease to 0 when hit by projectiles or enemies, and it is game over when it is 0
- Player's score increases as time progresses and enemies are eliminated
- Players can pick up random weapons around the map
- Saving and loading the game should be possible, along with resetting and storing highscores
- Enemies will vary, with different damage outputs, hitpoints and speed to reach player
## User Stories

- As a user, I want to keep track of my score
- As a user, I want to be able to save and load the game
